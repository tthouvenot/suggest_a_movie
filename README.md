# 🎬 Movie & Series Suggester

## 📖 Description

This project is a movie and TV series suggester designed to help you decide what to watch when endless scrolling kills your motivation.

Instead of relying on streaming platform algorithms, this app makes independent and unbiased suggestions based on your own library or selected platforms.
If you keep rejecting suggestions… the app will eventually get annoyed and tell you to figure it out yourself.

## ✨ Features

- Suggests movies or series from:
  - Local files
  - User-defined streaming platforms
  - Neutral suggestion engine (no platform algorithm influence)
- Tracks:
  - Watched content
  - Rejected suggestions
- Smart filtering (optional):
  - Genre
  - Duration
  - Already watched / rewatchable content
- Refusal counter with sarcastic responses after multiple rejections

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to build a simple, fun, and honest decision helper:
- No infinite scrolling
- No recommendation bias
- Just “pick something and watch it”
If you refuse too many times, the app assumes you don’t really want to watch anything.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- CLI-based (for now)
- Offline-first design
- Extensible for future API integration (TMDb, OMDb, etc.)

## 🚧 Project Status

- Early-stage / MVP
- Focused on core logic before adding external APIs or a GUI
